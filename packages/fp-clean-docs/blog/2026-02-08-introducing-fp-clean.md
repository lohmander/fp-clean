# Welcome to fp-clean

fp-clean is a TypeScript library designed with one goal in mind: **making the safe way the easy way**.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why fp-clean?

After working with various functional programming libraries, we noticed that while they provide powerful abstractions, they often come with steep learning curves and complex APIs. fp-clean aims to bridge this gap by providing:

- **Type-safe dependency injection** without runtime overhead
- **Streaming computations** with built-in error handling
- **Composable operations** that can be combined freely
- **Resource safety** with automatic cleanup

## The Five Pillars

Every design decision in fp-clean is guided by our five core principles:

1. **Safe** - No exceptions, all errors explicit
2. **Composable** - Operations combine without side effects
3. **Explicit** - No hidden state, clear dependencies
4. **Clean up** - Resources always released properly
5. **Observable** - Streaming for monitoring and debugging
